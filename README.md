# Maple

A failed attempt at creating a floating, wayland compositor. Based on [tinywl](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots/-/blob/master/tinywl/tinywl.c) and inspired from various other wayland compositors.

## Current Status

Archived and abandoned. This became a lot harder as I was looking at different code implementations and trying to combine them into logical functions in separate files. I will actually fork tinywl and add features.
